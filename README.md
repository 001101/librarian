# librarian

Librarian is a tiny CMS for static content, written in PHP on top of `minicli`. Good for small read-only dynamic pages (content can be pulled from different sources) and documentation.

* No database
* No sessions
* No users

Librarian supports content written in markdown with an optional front-matter section for metadata.

More info coming soon. This is a WIP
